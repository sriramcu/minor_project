# Buffer optimization in data plane for SDNs using Reinforcement Learning

As a part of the minor project at RVCE in Computer Science, this project attempted to optimize queue lengths using RL in Python, leading to a limited, partially successful outcome. This repo now serves as a documentation of the proof of concept, which can be expanded upon in the future.

Final minor project report has been uploaded to this repository to explain what we tried in detail.
